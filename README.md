# PurrSims
A repository for my simple top-down 2D FFXIV mechanic simulators.

For now there is just one mechanic simulation but the framework exists to add more mechanics to the mechanic selector.

To use this simulator, a browser that supports the HTML canvas is needed, and JavaScript must be enabled/allowed to run. Mobile/touchscreen controls are not currently tested or supported. Your screen must be capable of displaying a 900px x 900 px area in its entirety without scrolling.

## Currently supported mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Arcane Array

## Planned mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Spatial Tactics

## Known issues
Known issues are shown on the simulator page itself.
