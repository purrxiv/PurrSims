# PurrSims
A repository for my simple top-down 2D FFXIV mechanic simulators.

For now there is just one mechanic simulation but the framework exists to add more mechanics to the mechanic selector.

To use this simulator, a browser that supports the HTML canvas is needed, and JavaScript must be enabled/allowed to run. Mobile/touchscreen controls are not currently tested or supported. Your screen must be capable of displaying a 900px x 900 px area in its entirety without scrolling.

## Currently supported mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Analysis/Arcane Array

## Planned mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Spatial Tactics

## Known issues
Known issues are shown on the simulator page itself.

Not that you would probably want to anyway, as this web page is as barebones as it gets, and my JavaScript is a mess.
