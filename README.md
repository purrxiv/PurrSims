# PurrSims
A repository for my simple top-down 2D FFXIV mechanic simulators.

For now there is just one mechanic simulation with no menu or option for selecting others, but adding other mechanics and a menu to select them in the future is definitely possible.

To use these simulators, a browser that supports the HTML canvas is needed, and JavaScript must be enabled/allowed to run. Mobile/touchscreen controls are not currently tested or supported.

## Currently supported mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Arcane Array (Under development)

## Planned mechanics
### Another Aloalo Island
- Spatial Tactics
