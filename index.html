    <h2>FFXIV Mechanic Simulator by <a href="https://purr.moe">Purrnyan Mew'uwu@Diabolos</a></h2>
    <p>May the...<span style="font-style: italic">fruits</span>...of your time spent practicing here taste like sweet, sweet prog.</p>
    <p>This is a very quick, dirty, simple, and jank simulator mostly made for my own use, but it gets the job done.</p>

    <h3>Known Issues</h3>
    <h4>Analysis + Arcane Array</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>After wiping to the first orb on the first run, the boss cleave from the first run lingers during the second run, likely causing a wipe. After wiping/resetting a second time (so from the third run onwards), the simulator functions as normal again.</li>
    </ul>
